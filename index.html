        <strong>Xing Xing</strong>, who's name means "Twin Stars", is a Tibetan Macaque monkey who was rescued and now lives in Daliang Mountain in East China. She only has one arm due to a loss of the other when she was harmed by a wild boar trap. She was then sold to a circus after being found in this condition. Shorlty after she went on to live in a restaurant so she could entertain customers, but due to her large appetite she also had to leave the restaurant.

         <strong>Xing Xing</strong> was lucky to come across an elderly Buddhist nun who the internet refers to as "Grandma" (<em>as she is like  <strong>Xing Xing's</strong> Grandmother</em>) where she has lived ever since. So, <strong>Xing Xing</strong> is not <em>just</em> a charming and cute persona, she is the epitome of perserverance.
