        Xing Xing is a Tibetan Macaque monkey who was rescued and now lives in Daliang Mountain in East China. She only has one arm due to a loss of the other when she was harmed by a wild boar trap. She was then sold to a circus after being found in this condition. Shorlty after she went on to live in a restaurant so she could entertain customers but due to her large appetite she also had to leave the restaurant.
